## CofD Compendium
This is a compendium module for the MTA system in FoundryVTT, compiling a bunch of information from the books to use for your Chronicles of Darkness games.

Not everything is implemented yet, but I've been working on adding most things.

Compatible for V11

### Features
* A storyteller screen for easy reference
* Various items such as armour and weapons
* (Most) Merits
* Vampire powers, disciplines and banes
* Werewolf powers, rites and gifts
* Mage spells
* Tilts and conditions

### PDFs
Due to how big the PDFs are, I can't include them in the module zip itself. If you want the PDF journal links to work in your games, just download them yourself and place them in /modules/cofd-compendium/pdfs/

For example, if you download the "Vampire the Requiem 2e.pdf" file, you would want to have it be in "/modules/cofd-compendium/pdfs/Vampire the Requiem 2e.pdf"
